<img src="images/BLOC_1_schema.png" width=90%>

## Explanation 
Why v2 ? An ugly 1st version is available here : https://github.com/markov-ngz/DEVIA_BLOC_1  . And still please not that this pipeline is not even "clean" as the purpose was to learn basic knowledge on Kafka/Hadoop/Airflow.<br>
## Apache Airflow DAGs
Apache Airflow is set up locally (via astro , see https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/get-started-with-airflow ).
The Docker provider is installed so that the scheduler can run docker container on host ( see "automation" folder on how to mount host docker socket to the scheduler container).
2 DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graph) are scheduled to run monthly : <br>
<b>Kafka DAG</b>

<b>Hadoop DAG</b> <br>
